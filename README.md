# Detecting-Cardiac-Pathologies-in-MRI-scans
This project focuses on developing an automated system for detecting and characterizing cardiac pathologies from MRI scans. Leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to accurately identify conditions such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis.
